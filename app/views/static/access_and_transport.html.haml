      Cyprus has <strong>two</strong> international airports in Larnaca and Paphos.

    %p

    %p
      New modern Larnaca airport became fully operational in November 2009 and can accommodate 7.5 million per year.

          %li A smaller cargo dock also exists at Vasilikos, near Zygi (a small town between Larnaca and Limassol). Smaller vessels and private yachts can dock at marinas in Cyprus.
          %li Both Larnaca and Limassol are cruise ship called in Cyprus, although Limassol receives more vessels. There are passenger facilities at both ports, also used by ferries taking people to the Middle East.
          %li <strong>Cyprus is keen</strong> to develop as a bigger cruise hub in the MediterÂ­ranean and is enjoying increasing success. More cruise lines are now venturing through the Suez Canal to the Red Sea and the Gulf.
